It was an amazing afternoon with delicious food, friendly competition and wholesome grocery shopping.


<br><br>

We had Dim Sum for lunch at [Wing Tai Restaurant](https://g.co/kgs/uspQtdX) near Brent Cross West. 
The table was filled with asian dishes such as Siu Mai, Cheong Fun and Nai Wong Bao. There was
a wide variety of food too to cater to vegan and kosher members of the lab.

The main event of the outing was Laser Tag! We split into two teams (Team Bubble Tea vs Team Peanut Milk).
We had 2 rounds of fun, running around firing lasers and getting shot at. The place was decently sized 
with good defensive covers and places to hide. Team Bubble Tea came out victorious with an average score of
754 points.
